                            glide along space rails and jump from planet to planet by collecting solar orbs.

                            This game was created during a 6-week school project by a team of 9 students, consisting of
                            designers, artists and programmers. The game was shaped under the prompt "natural
                            phenomena". My primary focus during this project was gameplay design but I also worked
                            across disciplines and contributed in other areas as needed.

                    <p>
                        I played a key role in shaping the gameplay experience of Little Cosmos and developed a vision
                        for
                        what the game should feel like and how it should play. I spent the initial part of the project
                        conceptualizing and
                        exploring ideas. I was responsible for refining the core game concept, creating a gameplay loop
                        and ensuring a cohesive gameplay experience.

                    <h3>Core Concept</h3>
                    <p>
                        The basic concept for the game was decided on as a team through a number of brainstorming
                        sessions. The focus would be on gravity, the game would be set in space and played as a
                        character in third person. The game took shape early on in the development process by testing
                        out systems
                        and prototypes to form an idea of what the game could potentially become.

                    <p>
                        To create a gameplay loop I needed to connect the core idea to an objective and game
                        progression.
                        I took the established pieces of the game and brought it together
                        into something playable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Starting on a planet, the player engages in platforming and exploration. The player
                        needs to collect a certain amount of pickups, orbs of solar energy, to charge up
                        a battery.
                        Once fully charged the player can use a mega jump pad to launch themselves into space. The
                        player is taken to the next planet through a cinematic launch with a superhero landing. This
                        discharges the
                        battery and the player is free to roam and collect pickups once again. The pickup system in
                        combination with the mega
                        jump
                        pads establishes a sense of
                        accomplishment and efficiently conveys game
                        progression.

                    <p>
                        The character moves in relation to the camera position and there was an issue with jittery camera movement as the player moved around in the environment. To decrease this I added
                        camera smoothing so that the camera is always slightly chasing the player. Camera collision was kept to a minimum as to not interfere with player navigation.
                        I adjusted the player movement such as jump height and movement speed and I opted for an inreased gravity force in order to keep movement and jumps suitable for platforming.

                        As part of gameplay design I was responsible for generating ideas, prototyping various
                        gameplay elements and requesting assets in order to bring
                        the game to life. These prototypes were later refined along with programmers and artists into
                        final level assets.

                        Since space is a pretty vast environment I wanted to make it more interesting to move around in
                        by mixing classic
                        platforming components
                        with other ideas, drawing inspiration from things found in space and nature, or just imagination.

                        In the second half of the project I moved over to level design. I used the original ideas from
                        the first iteration of the level and built a second and final
                        iteration. This allowed me to playtest and tweak the level as I was building it.

                        I implemented and tested any new gameplay elements and game additions, and made sure that
                        platforming was still feasible with any current movement adjustments.
                        I adjusted the flow and pacing of the level, ensuring that new settings, mechanics, and level
                        progression felt satisfying as gameplay elements were introduced on each planet.

                        This problem hit pretty early on in the
                        project as there was no real sense of up, everything was relative to the planets. The
                        programmers were able to create a system for us to use that would rotate
                        the assets toward the center of gravity. It helped tremendously while building but I would
                        still get a bit nauseous while moving and rotating the camera around.

                        assets and implemented them in widgets and the functionality was integrated by the programmers.

                            implement and update alongside custom pieces for more specific needs.

                    <p>
                        For the in game UI I wanted to keep it simple but still convey the objective. The battery is
                        visible at all times to hint at what the player should do and to track the amount of solar
                        charges. Once the battery is full the mega jump pad is activated, showing an objective prompt
                        and
                        location marker. The mega jump pad has a countdown for a more impactful takeoff.

                        <p>
                            For a minimal design I used a white color for text and black for backgrounds and worked with
                            with opacity, blurs
                            and shadows. A soft yellow was used for solar related assets which ties back to the
                            characters
                            backpack, shoes and trail. Red was used as the main color in menus and for accents.

                        <p>
                            For the text I wanted something that would fit the space theme while still feeling playful
                            and clean. I paired two different fonts, one for main headings and one for any other style
                            of text. They share similar traits but are still different enough from one another to
                            provide contrast.
