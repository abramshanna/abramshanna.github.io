                            This game was created during a 6-week school project by a team of 9 students, consisting of
                            designers, artists and programmers. The game was shaped under the prompt "symbiosis". My
                            main responsibility during this project was to manage the project, entailing anything from
                            refining
                            the core game idea, requesting assets and technical implementation to managing teams,
                            communication and planning.

                    <p>
                        I helped shape the gameplay experience of Ocean Buddie by guiding the vision
                        for what the game should feel like and how it should play. I spent the initial part of the
                        project
                        conceptualizing and
                        exploring ideas, and I was responsible for ensuring a cohesive gameplay experience throughout
                        the
                        project.

                    <h3>Core Concept</h3>
                    <p>
                        The idea was to create a local co-op puzzle adventure game featuring two different characters,
                        one on land and one in water. To play off the given theme of symbiosis the players are bound to
                        their own element where they operate efficiently and with ease. The game is set in a tropical
                        archipelago, with islands and the ocean as the two main elements. The environment and art
                        direction strongly inspired and influenced the development of the game and its mechanics.

                    <h3>Gameplay Loop</h3>
                    <p>
                        The game is linear and starts at the beginning of the islands, where players are quickly
                        introduced to their movement patterns and any platforming elements. As the
                        pair makes their way through the level the puzzles are introduced one by one along with the
                        individual mechanics.
                        Puzzles get progressively more difficult and each of the puzzles are unique. If players do not
                        cooperate
                        they can not progress through the level and all puzzles have to be completed in order to reach
                        the end of the game.

                    <h3>Movement and Camera</h3>
                    <p>
                        The idea was for movement to feel different for each character and was therefore
                        adapted to
                        their
                        element. Swimmie is agile and can swim and
                        jump high in the water, while Landie can run around on land, pick things up as well as climb.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The original idea was to implement a dynamic split screen camera, but failed due to technical
                        difficulties. Instead it was settled on a static split camera and opted for a sidescroller
                        style and
                        layout in order for players to get a
                        good overview of each puzzle and the environment, as well as to not loose the other player as
                        easily.

                    <p>
                        The puzzles and the level were planned, created and implemented by the level designers. I aided
                        in preparation of the level assets, merging art assets with scripts and adding colliders. I
                        assisted in drawing out the islands by hand, general scene dressing and setting up the menu
                        scenes, as well as creating some visual effects. Playtesting of the puzzles was crucial to make sure that things were working as intended and to discover any bugs.

                        The main goal of the in game UI was to convey the controls and mechanics to the players. The UI
                        shows if the player is close to an intractable object. Hints for puzzles are provided to
                        players through a prompt by the parrot plastie if the players walk up to him.

                    <p>
                        The menus were kept simple and a fade was implemented in
                        between menus and the game for a soft transition. The player can pause the game and is provided
                        with an end screen if they complete the game.

                        <p>
                            For a minimal design I used a white color for text and a very bright turquoise for
                            backgrounds. I worked with shadows and opacity to make the text more readable. This was in
                            hindsight a poor color choice and combination, especially against the bright game as the
                            contrast was too low.

                        <p>
                            For the text I wanted something that felt fun and that fit the playful ocean theme. I paired
                            two different fonts, one for main headings and one for any other style
                            of text. They share similar traits but are still different enough from one another to
                            provide contrast.
